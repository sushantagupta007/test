#1 In case if you want to change the categories of cards then you have to change the path in some JS files

1) WeddingSection.js :- This file loads the cards in WeddingSection.html.
In line number  31 - 35, this script is written !

const LocationMap = {
  allcards: ["weddingcard2/allcards/cards"],
  royal: ["weddingcards/royal/cards"],
};

statically, the code is fetching the data from allCards category, so simply change the path of first key like this

const LocationMap = {
  allcards: [<path to another category>],
  royal: ["weddingcards/royal/cards"],
};


#2 In case if you want to change the prices of cards you have to change the path in some JS files

The application is fetching prices from this path => `weddingcards/price` which is in line number 292, in WeddingSection.js
statically, the code is fetching the price from weddingcards, so you can change the path to change the pricing !
